            question: "What is a Life Path Number?",
            answer: "Your Life Path Number is derived from your birth date and represents your core purpose and life mission. It reveals the inherent traits, challenges, and opportunities that shape your journey through life."
          },
          {
            question: "How is the Life Path Number calculated?",
            answer: "The Life Path Number is calculated by reducing your birth date (month/day/year) to a single digit or master number (11, 22). Each component is reduced separately, then combined and reduced again to reach your final Life Path Number."
          },
          {
            question: "What are Master Numbers?",
            answer: "Master Numbers (11, 22) are powerful spiritual numbers that carry special significance. If your Life Path calculation results in these numbers, they are not reduced further as they represent heightened spiritual potential and challenges."

          },
          {
            question: "How does the Expression Number differ from the Life Path Number?",
            answer: "While your Life Path Number represents your life's purpose and journey, your Expression Number shows how you naturally express yourself and the talents you bring to fulfill that purpose."
          },
          {
            question: "Can my Expression Number change?",
            answer: "Your core Expression Number remains constant as it's based on your birth name. However, if you legally change your name, you may have a second Expression Number that influences your life alongside your birth name number."

            question: "How can I use my numbers for personal growth?",
            answer: "Understanding your Life Path and Expression numbers helps you align with your natural strengths and navigate challenges. Use them as guides for making decisions, choosing career paths, and understanding relationship dynamics."
          },
          {
            question: "How often should I consult my numbers?",
            answer: "While your core numbers remain constant, their influence manifests differently during various life phases. Regular reflection on their meanings can provide fresh insights as you face new situations and challenges."
          },
          {
            question: "Can numerology predict my future?",
            answer: "Rather than predicting specific events, numerology reveals patterns and potentials. Your numbers indicate natural tendencies and opportunities, but free will always plays a crucial role in how you utilize these energies."
